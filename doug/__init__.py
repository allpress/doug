Doug - Multi-repository context caching and indexing system.

Doug helps AI coding assistants efficiently understand and navigate
large, multi-repository codebases by creating structured JSON indexes
of repositories, APIs, source files, and external integrations.

Look, I didn't ask for this job. But here I am, indexing your repos
like some kind of digital librarian who actually knows where things are.
You're welcome.
